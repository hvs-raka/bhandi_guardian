# High! Help?

A fun project made for High people.

I build this to practice Flutter language and Hive DB. This consist of some features that you might need while you're high like Todo List (basic one), Playlist options, Visit Location option for safety call guardian and home location feature and a small section that's gonna help you in yo BT. 

NOTE: Not really a app that's gonna help you while having BT but as I mentioned it's a Fun Project. But it'll surely help you remember some things and set your playlist and visit locations so you don't have to go through that hassle just lay back and enjoy music or trip.
